A quiet, layered finish consolidates around lemon and lavender.   -  Notes: The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. The Overtons auction their best lots every year; this lot was #11 in the 2019 auction. It is a wet-processed or washed version, in which the skin and pulp of the fruit is removed before the coffee is dried, resulting here in a particularly bright, high-toned up.

All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures.

The majority of Gesha coffees are grown in the Boquete region of Panama, but there is increased experimentation with this variety throughout Latin America, especially Colombia, where this exceptional version was grown. Joe Van Gogh is a small-batch roasting company with a focus on certified organic coffees. In addition to its Internet store, it operates six coffeehouses in Durham, Chapel Hill and Greensboro, North Carolina.

With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety of Arabica continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s rarest and most unique coffees.

Produced from locally naturalized cultivars of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed at the now famous Bufcafe mills. Epiphanie Mukashyaka established the first Bufcafe washing station or wet mill following the Rwandan genocide and the loss of most of her family. She and her son now operate two wet mills and a dry mill in the area. Processed by the conventional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. A wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying using a particularly complex dry-ferment, wash and soak procedure popular in Rwanda.

Notes of cocoa-toned pipe tobacco predominate in the short finish, while hibiscus and foresty fallen-leaf notes figure prominently in the long.
  -  Notes: Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” Black Coffee in Black Jar, a Taiwan-based nano-roaster and café, is named for both the Taiwanese slang phrase “black soy sauce in black jar,” indicating something is difficult to see through, and the literal black jar in which this company stores coffee to protect it from UV light.

Lush, rose-like flowers, dark chocolate, cedar, almond, ripe pineapple in aroma and cup. Balanced and complete in structure, poised at a round, satisfying intersection of sweet, tart and bitter. Light but syrupy in texture. Layered and resonant in the finish: rose, chocolate, almond all ring on.  -  Notes: Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. I continue to feel that it must have some direct relationship with Yemen, however, where varieties displaying the same, very unusual bean size and shape are known as Ismaili, as well as by other local names. This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm.

The finish leads with citrus and berry notes in the short, segueing to sandalwood-framed sweet florals in the long.  -  Notes: Produced entirely from trees of the Kurume and Welicho varieties of Arabica at Suke Quto farm. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin of the coffee fruit is removed, as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. This coffee is both organic- and Rainforest Alliance-certified. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins.

GK Coffee,Gesha Village Ethiopia Lot #18 Illubabor Washed,93,"Yilan City, Taiwan","Bench-Maji Zone, Southern Ethiopia",Medium-Light,53/74,NT $800/113.5 grams,September 2017,9,8,9,9,8," GK Coffee  -  Blind Assessment: Crisply sweet; resonant, distinctive. Baker’s chocolate, raspberry, tea rose, almond, musk in aroma and cup. Sweet, almost sugary in structure, with a dry, tart/savory counterpoint. Full, plump mouthfeel. A musky chocolate and raspberry edge carries into a sweetly and roundly drying finish.   -  Notes: This coffee tied for fourth-highest rating in a tasting of 20 coffees of the Gesha (also spelled Geisha) variety for Coffee Review‘s September 2017 tasting report. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s rarest and most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. GK provides quality specialty coffee to consumers and retailers.
